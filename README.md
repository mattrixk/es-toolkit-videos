# ES Toolkit Videos
Preview Videos to go with [ES Toolkit](https://github.com/mattrixk/es-toolkit).

I had to separate the videos out of the [ES Toolkit](https://github.com/mattrixk/es-toolkit) because they just took up too much space. This way anyone that wants them can get them, but if someone doesn't want them, they don't have to get them.

Within this Repo are Video Previews for the Gameboy, N64, NES and SNES Roms that are available within the [ES Toolkit](https://github.com/mattrixk/es-toolkit). There are no Videos for Gameboy Advance, as they didn't have any for that System on screenscraper.fr.

- Gameboy - 20 videos
- N64 - 20 videos
- NES - 19 videos
- SNES - 20 videos

There are 79 videos for a total of about 45MB. The videos were scraped from screenscraper.fr using the [Universal XML Scraper](https://github.com/Universal-Rom-Tools/Universal-XML-Scraper/). I then ran them through [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to make them as small as possible and still be somewhat watchable. They're small and blurry, but they're just for testing purposes, you wouldn't use them in your normal set up.
